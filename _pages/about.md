As a **econometrician**, I use machine learning tools to explore 
- optimal policy design in asymptotic sense 
- human-computer interaction in decision making 
- (optimal) transport perspective of statistical estimation 

Roughly speaking, I try to provide mathematical explanations for empirically successful machine learning methods and to justify their application in economic problems. 

I am a third-year PhD candidate at the [Institution of Economics, School of Social Sciences, Tsinghua University](https://www.tioe.tsinghua.edu.cn/). During my research, I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jingyuan Wang](https://www.bigscity.com/), Professor [Ke Tang](https://sites.google.com/view/ketangs-research-page/home), and Professor [Han Hong](https://profiles.stanford.edu/han-hong).
